  "Dispatch events when subscriptions change.

  Tracking a subscription is a stateful process that needs to be registered and
  disposed of using an id.

  Fx input map:

  `:action` either `:register` or `:dispose`
  `:id` any value
  `:subscription` a subscription vector
  `:event-fn` a fn of a subscription value to an event vector.

  Once a track for a subscription is registered, every time that subscription
  updates the track will invoke `:event-fn` with the subscription's value, it
  should return an event vector for `re-frame.core/dispatch` or nil for a no-op.

  Usage:

  (require '[vimsical.re-frame.fx.track :as fx.track])

  0. Context

    Given the following subscription:

    (re-frame/reg-sub ::my-sub (fn [_ sub-arg] ...))

    We want to invoke a handler for every update

    (re-frame/reg-event ::my-sub-did-update (fn [_ sub-arg sub-value] ...))

  1. Register a track

    (re-frame/reg-event-fx
      ::register-track
      (fn [cofx event]
       {::track/register
        {:id           :my-track
         :subscription [::my-sub \"my-sub-arg\"]
         :event-fn     (fn [sub-value] [::my-sub-did-update \"my-sub-arg\" sub-value])}}))

  2. Dispose of the track using its id

    (re-frame/reg-event-fx
      ::dispose-track
      (fn [cofx event]
       {::fx.track/dispose
        {:id :my-track}}))

   [re-frame.core :as re-frame]
